                    A short documentary about two cinemas which were located in
                    Prizren, Serbia (Kosovo). From the time of Yugoslavia, to the present day,
                    and the impact they've had on the town, the people, and the
                    collective unconscious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The documentary posseses a unique style, blending both objective
                    perspective with archive material, and the interviews of people
                    whose lives were shaped by the cinemas, along with subjective
                    narration from the eyes of a lyrical subject who was present
                    and together with the cinemas through each point in their history.

                    This originally started as final exercise for a film class I had
                    attended at the Yugoslav cinematheque, organised by
                    <a href="https://filmkultura.com">Filmkultura</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gradually, it grew from a simple desire to shoot a western
                    inspired duel, to an almost 10 minute long meditation inside
                    the atmosphere of New Belgrade blocks during winter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was an exercise in pure style, and none of it would be possible
                    without my long time best friend, my Morricone, Luka Obradović.
                    We had worked on some smaller projects of mine previously, but
                    this was the first relatively serious endeavour on which we
                    collaborated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fruitfull collaboration it was indeed, and his music elevated
                    this short film into something more than it actually is - all
                    thanks to his fantastic music, which inspired me to compose shots
                    and scenes worthy of its magic.
