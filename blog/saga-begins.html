                So, this is where it starts, huh?
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly, I started writing this blogpost and this whole page
                with some thought in mind, I could swear. But it escapes me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh yeah, the philosophy of this webpage, I guess? It's all
                quite simple in essence. Somebody once dropped a thought, that
                went about as follows (paraphrasing): <br><br>
                <i>
                    "You should stop being an internet peasant, and become an
                    Internet Landlord."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea seemed interesting, so I proceeded with making it real.
            </p>
            <p>
                And here I am now, living the dream of having my own webpage,
                written as I see fit for it to be written.
            </p>
