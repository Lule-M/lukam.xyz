			<p> The pinnacle of human evolution, smartphones, finally utilised in the most braindead backwards way imaginable! </p> <p> After being reminded that the iPhone could run shell scripts over ssh via its Shortcuts app, I couldn't help but come up with the most idiotic possible application for that... </p> <p><b>Mobile blogging</b></p> <p> ... and so began my quest on writing a shell script which would take the boilerplate html for a typical page in my /blog/ section, and somehow inject into it the text from my phone, along with the system date (because what good is an article if there is no date of publishing?). <p>Now of course, there was a matter of the Shortcut on the phone itself, which turned out to be a bigger headache than the script which spits out html files containing the blog itself and updates the index file. </p> <p> The Shortcut was quite a beast to wrangle, seeing as once you get used to typing code, drag-and-drop tends to feel like you are speaking some alien language where everything is oddly visual. <p> And on top of it, the SSH connection doesn't allow for command arguments longer than a certain amount of characters (well below the typical blog length), so certain hackery with writing to temp files, echoing them and deleting them afterwards was required to get everything working. </p> <p> Alas, I am proud to announce this new era of mobile blogging, and invite you all to share my joy of reinventing the wheel! </p>
